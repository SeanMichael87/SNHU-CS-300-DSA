# SNHU-CS-300-DSA

**What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?**

Throughout this course we worked with three main data structures to determine which would best be implemented in a basic course planning C++ program. The program required the ability to parse seperate text or csv files into the required structure properly. First, we worked with vectors, then Hashtables, and finaly Binary Search Trees. Due to the simplicity of the program, I felt it was best to go with a vector data structure. It was also required to provide an option to print each course out alphanumerically. I chose to implement quick sort algorithm to solve this problem.

**How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.**

When debating which data structure to apply for the project, it came down to either the vector or BST. A hashtable was simply too difficult to implement a sorting method without the added space complexity of first putting into a proper array. The vector was chosen over the binary search tree because of the simplicity of the program and the ability to run the program in a similar time complexity, especially with the sort method (O(log n)). I felt more confident in my ability working wiht this structure, but as I get more comfortable working with linked nodes and trees I cannot wait to implement the strategies I learned in this short class.

**How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?**

Throughout this class I have certainly had my moments of frustration, many times it was best for me to simply walk away, refresh my mind and come back to the problem and reach out for help if I am really stuck. Other times, it required me to absorb Youtube videos to get a different perspective on how to handle a problem. Regardless, I perservered and throughly enjoyed learning the subject matter in this class. 

**How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?**

One thing that I really need to practice more of is pseudocode. I realized its value moreso in this class than any other taken so far at SNHU. It really made Project Two so much easier to get through. I simply followed my outline and when I got stuck, I easily found examples on StackOverflow to help guide me further. After this class, I finally found confidence to make my way through working through Leetcode and CodeSignal problems-pseudocode has certainly helped my build my algorithms for these as well.

**How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**

Organization and applying DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) techniquies are the keys to maintainable, readable, and adaptable codeing. There were certain instances within my code where I was tempted to repeat myself, such as with the print method. Instead, I looked for ways to limit extra clutter in my code and structure the program methods in ways that were readable. It has certain helped me in that area, but I know I could improve in others. For instance, the parsing methods should have been in their own class for implementation. I could have also applied more encapsulation and followed other OOP principles better. There are always ways to learn and improve.
